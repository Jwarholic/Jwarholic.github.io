		<h2> About Me:</h2>
		  <article id="article">
			<p>
			Fitness is one of my favorite hobbies. One of my life missions is to be the best me and to achieve dreams and goals that will push me into becoming a better version of myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			 I have had many ups and downs with fitness. Through trial and error I have learned what it takes to become in better shape. I have points in my life where I go <strong>All in</strong> with what I am doing. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			I have learned that <strong>being consistent</strong> is the most important factor in becoming better. How much effort I put in how much I am rewarded.  I have been down to that 6-9 percent body fat at my peak. I quickly lose that when I decide I want to eat whatever I want and not exercise or take breaks. Even though I know what I need to do to maintain that dream physique, it's very 	easy to lose it as well. I'm now more inspired than ever and ready to push myself to new limits.

			<p> Tihs is one of my go to websites. I viewed the page source and recognize some of the html elements such as list and headers. I could also see some of the CSS code and javascript codes. I also really like how they have a header that consist of navigational menus and a footer with more information.
