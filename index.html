		<h2> A little about me:</h2>
		<p>
		Fitness is one of my favorite hobbies. One of my life missions is to be the best me and to achieve dreams and goals that will push me into becoming a better version of myself.
		</p>
		<p>
		 I have had many ups and downs with fitness. Through trial and error I have learned what it takes to become in better shape. I have points in my life where I go <strong>All in</strong> with what I am doing. 
		</p>
		<p> 
		I have learned that <strong>consitancy</strong> is the most important factor in becoming better. Unfortunately, for bodybuilding when I take breaks it shows. I have been down to that 6-9 percent body fat at my peak. Unfourtntely I quickly lose that when I decide I want to eat whatever I want and not exercise or take breaks. Even though I know what I need to do to maintain that dream physique, it's very easy to lose it as well.

		<h2>A cool website I like to use</h2>

		<p><a href="www.bodybuilding.com">Bodybuilding.com</a>
		</p>
		<p> They have a simplistic yet proffesional themed webpage. I was able to view the page source and recognize some of the html elements such as list and headers. I could also see some of the CSS code and javascript codes. I also really like how they have a header that consist of navigational menus and a footer with more information.
